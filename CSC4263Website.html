<h2>Our Game</h2>
<p>Our game, currently named "Project Covered Stars", is a space fantasy game that takes place in the future.  Despite being in the future, the game features 
medieval undertones such as warring houses.  It is a top-down view 2D game.  The main character has a melee weapon and many abilities.  It is 
on a quest to kill all of the enemies in the level.</p>

<h3>Madison</h3>
<p>I’m currently a senior General Arts major with dual minors in Digital Media Arts Engineering and Art History. I’ll be the 
head of graphics for our team, and will focus on producing an aesthetically pleasing game. I don’t play as many games as I wish 
I did, but every now and then when I’m free I’ll play Minecraft. I love storytelling, character design, and illustration, 
and how they can add to a game’s narrative!</p><br>

<h3>Jacob</h3>
<p>Hello! I’m Jacob Carter, a Computer Science and Electrical Engineering double major at LSU. 
I’ve loved video games since I was a kid, growing up with the Wii and Xbox 360. 
Nowadays I love platformers and fighting games, with HollowKnight and Super Smash Bros. 
Melee being my favorite game of all time. I don’t currently plan on going into the games industry after college, 
but I enjoy making games as a hobby to express myself.</p><br>
